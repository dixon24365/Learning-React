 Challenge: "Team Profile Card Generator"
Goal: Build a small React app that displays a list of team members using props.

💡 Features:
A TeamMember component that receives props: name, role, profilePic, and bio.

A parent Team component that maps over an array of team member objects and renders multiple TeamMember components.

Optional: Add a button to toggle showing the bio or not (just to mix in state later).

  },
  {

    profilePic: "https://via.placeholder.com/150",
    bio: "Node.js wizard and API master."
  },

    role: "UI/UX Designer",
    profilePic: "https://via.placeholder.com/150",
    bio: "Passionate about clean design and user experience."
  }
];
🧩 What You’ll Practice:
Passing props (name, role, bio, etc.)

Reusable components

Mapping over arrays

Basic styling (optional)

✅ Bonus:
Add a prop like isAvailable and show “Available” or “Busy” with different colors.

Add a hover effect on each card using CSS to improve UI.
